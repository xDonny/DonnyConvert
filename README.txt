Purpose:

Browsing online for some quick converter tools found a lot of shareware that came with adware and spyware, so I decided to create this software to help my fellow media consumers out.

This program requires python, you can find that here:

This program uses ffmpeg, licenses for which can be found in the licenses folder. 

This software is provided for free. Modify,distribute,sell, or do whatever with this software. However it is provided without warranty, I'm not responsible for anything that results from the use of this software. Use at your own risk.
